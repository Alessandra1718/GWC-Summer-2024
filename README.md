**Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program**

Over the course of two weeks during Summer 2024, I participated in the GWC Summer Immersion Program, learning and creating different game projects. 
We worked with javascript and the p5play Library. Each project had various difficulty levels, and lots of space for creativity.

I have uploaded the .js files to github to showcase my projects:
- Interactie Avatar
  - This is a simple character that blinks his eyes when you press on the screen.
- Collection Style Game
  - This is a simple game where you move the platform at the bottom of the screen left and rigth to try and collect as many falling objects as possible while a counter variable keeps score in the top left corner. 
- Choose Your Own Adventure Game


The starter code for all these projects was forked from Girls Who Code on Replit.com . 
The rest of the work is my own.
